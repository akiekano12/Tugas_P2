In assembly language, a register is a small, high-speed storage area within the CPU used to hold data, instructions, or memory addresses, enabling the CPU to process information quickly and efficiently. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:
What they are:
Registers are essentially tiny, fast memory locations built directly into the CPU, unlike RAM which is slower and outside the CPU. 
Why they are important:
The CPU uses registers to store the data it's currently working with, as well as instructions it's about to execute. This allows the CPU to access and manipulate data much faster than if it had to constantly fetch data from slower RAM. 
Examples:
Common examples of registers include the accumulator (A), index registers (like X and Y), stack pointer (SP), and program counter (PC).
